## Description

Fresh Tomatoes is a movie review application where you can look up a movie, rate it, and type a review about it! You are also able to see the reviews of other people on any movie that you'd like as well as their rating for it.

I built Fresh Tomatoes to create an interactive platform where movie enthusiasts can share their opinions and discover new films through community reviews. The app demonstrates full CRUD operations, user authentication with role-based access control, and a clean interface styled with Milligram CSS.

### User Stories
  
‚¶Å	As a user, I can sign up and log in to write a review and give a star rating, and log out.

‚¶Å	As a guest, I can browse movies, search by title, filter by rating, genre, or year, and read reviews.

‚¶Å	As the user, I can edit or delete my review.

‚¶Å	As an admin, I can add new movies, update details, and delete movies.

‚¶Å	As a user, I can view my profile with all my reviews.
